## 💻 Clean MVVM Architecture with Dagger Hilt 💻

- 💻 This project demonstrates the implementation of a Clean MVVM architecture using Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.

## 📚 Libraries 📚

- 📚 Kotlin Coroutines - For asynchronous programming
- 📚 Retrofit - For networking and API communication

- 📚 Dagger Hilt - For dependency injection
- 📚 Jetpack Compose - For building UI components
- 📚 JUnit and MockK - For testing
- 📚 Lottie: For Animations.
- 📚 Material 3: For the visual part.


##  🧮 Architecture 🧮

The project follows the Clean MVVM architecture, which consists of the following layers:

- 🧮 **Presentation Layer**: Contains the UI components, ViewModels, and Compose screens.
- 🧮 **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and use cases.
- 🧮 **Data Layer**: Contains the repositories, data sources, and API communication.
- 🧮  **Dependency Injection**: Uses Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.

## 📁 Folder Structure 📁

The project is structured as follows:
- 📁 app
 -  📁 src
  -   📁 main
    -   📁 java/com/example/myapp
        - 📁 data -> Contains repository implementations and data sources
        - 📁 domain -> Contains use cases and business logic
        - 📁 presentation -> Contains ViewModels and UI components
        - 📁 models -> Contains model classes and common constants
